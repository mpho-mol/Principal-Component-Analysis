Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction  technique used in statistics, data analysis and machine learning. Its main objective is to minimise the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much of the important data as possible by finding a new set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) variables called principal components that capture the most variance in the data.

The task was completed in Jupyter Notebook using the Iris data set which was loaded into a DataFrame using the pandas library. A plot was created using all the features to show the positive and negative correlations between them. The data was scaled then PCA was applied to it using n_components = 3. The transformed version of the data was also plotted. The two plots were compared and comments were made on what redundancy was likely to have been removed from the data.
